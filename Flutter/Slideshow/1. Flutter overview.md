### What is Flutter ?

1. A **framework**
2. **Open-Source**
3. Made by **Google**
4. Allow **native** applications for multiple platforms 
5. Single code-base
6. Same appearance and behavior
7. Designer First framework
8. Built in Dart

%%
Flutter is an open-source framework developed by Google, which enables the creation of native applications for multiple platforms from a single code base, and can provide applications with **identical appearance and behavior**, regardless of device or operating system. With Flutter, developers can create apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, as well as web applications, all using the Dart programming language. This versatility makes Flutter particularly useful for developers looking to expand app compatibility without requiring separate codebases for each platform. It's a designer first framework, which mean everything during its development is thinking about the design of the app. You can build the full mockup using flutter and give the widgets to the developers who will make it interactive.

**Reflection**: What makes Flutter stand out in cross-platform development?

---
#### The framework

Overview of the framework, Single codebase advantage, and multi-platform support.

%% 
Flutter is a comprehensive UI toolkit from Google designed for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It emphasizes high-performance apps with a **single codebase** that look and feel the same across different platforms, offering an efficient way to develop apps that feel native on any supported platform. It also features its own rendering engine (Skia) to maintain consistent appearance, independent of the device.
%%

---
#### Advantages and limitations of Flutter

---
##### Advantages

- Single codebase for multiple platforms saves development time and effort.
- High-performance rendering with Flutter’s own graphics engine (Skia).
- Hot reload speeds up development by instantly showing changes.
- Strong open-source community and support from Google.

%%
Flutter offers a number of advantages:

- **Native performance**: By using AOT compilation for production code, Flutter is optimized to run code directly on the device's processor, offering performance close to that of native applications, unlike solutions like Cordova.
- Hot-Reload**: During development, Hot-Reload allows you to instantly see code changes in the application without restarting it, speeding up the development cycle.
- Cross-platform portability**: A single code base can be used to create applications for Android, iOS, the Web, and even the desktop on Linux, MacOs and Windows.
- **Vast and active community**: The community around Flutter is large and growing, providing a broad base of widgets and libraries to meet diverse needs.
%%

---
##### Limitations

- Larger app size compared to natively built apps.
- Limited access to some platform-specific features.
- Less mature support for web and desktop compared to mobile.

%%
- Flutter’s compiled code can result in larger-than-usual app file sizes, especially compared to purely native apps.
- While it allows deep native integration, some platform-specific features may require additional effort or bridging, requiring writing some Flutter Plugins for each platform.
- Web and desktop support in Flutter, though improving, is still maturing and may not yet meet the demands of all types of applications.
%%

---
#### Key Flutter concepts (Widgets, Hot Reload, Dart)

- **Widgets**: The core building blocks of Flutter apps. Everything in Flutter is a widget (e.g., text, buttons, layouts).
- **Hot Reload**: Enables developers to see changes instantly in the app without restarting it, which speeds up development.
- **Dart**: The language used to write Flutter apps, designed for building fast apps with a clean, modern syntax.

%%
Widgets are the foundation of any Flutter application. They represent the visual and interactive elements, from simple text and buttons to complex layouts. 
The “Hot Reload” feature is invaluable during the development phase as it allows quick testing and iteration without restarting the app, saving both time and improving efficiency. Flutter was built to allow the best flexibility as possible using this feature.
Dart, as the language for Flutter, provides the structure and syntax to manage these widgets, enabling developers to build performant and scalable applications with ease.
%%

---

**Reflection**: How does Hot Reload contribute to faster development in Flutter?

%%
Hot Reload in Flutter significantly accelerates development by enabling developers to instantly view changes made to the code within the app itself. This rapid feedback loop streamlines debugging and feature experimentation without requiring a full restart of the application, thereby making development both more efficient and less error-prone.
%%

---
### Why Choose Flutter?

---
#### Flutter’s open-source ecosystem and contributions from Google

- **Open-Source Ecosystem**: Flutter is open source, meaning it is free to use and has a strong developer community constantly contributing to improvements.
- **Google’s Support**: Created and maintained by Google, Flutter has a strong foundation and benefits from continuous enhancements and reliable support.

%%
The open-source nature of Flutter allows it to grow and improve through contributions from developers worldwide, fostering innovation and quicker bug fixes. Google’s ongoing contributions add stability, reliability, and access to resources, reinforcing Flutter’s role in the app development landscape and giving developers confidence in its long-term viability.
%%

---
#### Comparison with other cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Xamarin, etc.)

- **React Native**: Uses JavaScript, allows access to native components, but requires bridging code for more advanced features.
- **Xamarin**: Uses C#, provides access to native APIs but can have larger build sizes and a slower build process compared to Flutter.

%%
Flutter stands out compared to frameworks like **React Native** and **Xamarin**. While React Native allows seamless integration with native code, it requires bridges for certain functions, potentially adding complexity. **Xamarin** allows developers to use C# and is deeply integrated with Microsoft tools, making it a good fit for enterprise apps. However, Flutter's performance and native feel, powered by its Skia graphics engine and AOT compilation, make it particularly appealing for those needing smooth, responsive UI.
%%

---

**Reflection**: What cross-platform advantage could be most beneficial to your app idea?

%%
Flutter stands out in cross-platform development primarily due to its **single codebase** approach, which allows developers to create apps for multiple platforms (like iOS, Android, web, and desktop) without duplicating code for each. Additionally, **Flutter's custom rendering engine (Skia)** ensures that the app looks and behaves consistently across different devices and operating systems, avoiding the dependency on native platform widgets. This setup supports **native performance** by compiling directly to machine code and provides **hot reload**, allowing developers to see changes instantly, which greatly speeds up the development process.
%%

%%
Flutter’s ability to provide a single codebase for multiple platforms is highly beneficial for projects needing a unified user experience across devices. The custom rendering engine helps achieve a consistent look and feel, which could reduce both development time and complexity, ensuring quick deployment to a wider audience.

### Exploring Flutter’s Components

---
#### Structure of a Flutter app, importance of widgets, and the app lifecycle

%%
A Flutter app starts with a `main.dart` file, acting as the entry point. Inside, widgets define the structure and behavior of the UI. Widgets are categorized as **Stateless** (unchanging, for static elements) or **Stateful** (can change over time). Understanding the app lifecycle is essential for efficient resource management and a responsive user experience, especially when dealing with data retrieval or state persistence.
%%

---
##### App Structure:
A typical Flutter app contains a `main.dart` file as the entry point. Apps are structured around widgets.

---
##### More and more widgets

- **Stateless Widgets**: 
	- Immutable: Once created, their state never changes
	- Used for simple interface elements that do not require updating

- **Stateful Widgets**: 
	- Mutable state: They can be dynamically updated
	- Used for complex interactions and animations

%%
In Flutter, the user interface is built from visual components called *widgets*. A widget is the basic element of any Flutter application, representing visual elements such as buttons, text, images or even layouts. In fact, everything in Flutter is a widget, and together they define the shape and behavior of your application.
There are two types of widgets in Flutter, Stateless Widgets and Stateful Widgets. Like they name tell, stateless is static widget, when it will refresh, the same display will be result from the same inputs. Where the Stateful Widget will save some context for itself and can for example increment a counter.
%%

---
###### Example: A Flutter Widget

%%
Here's an example of a simple *Stateless Widget* that displays a card containing the message `Hello, Flutter with Card!`, followed by stylized text `This is a Flex example.`
%%

```dart nums
class CardExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Flex(
      direction: Axis.vertical,
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Card(
          elevation: 4,
          color: Colors.lightBlue[50],
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter with Card!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blueAccent),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 16.0),
          child: Text(
            'This is a Flex example.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

---

1. **CardExample**: This is a *StatelessWidget* that display a card `'Hello, Flutter with Card!'` followed by a text `'This is a Flex example.'`. The widget defined here will generate its layout and display components from the result of the build `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method.

```dart
class CardExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    ...
  }
}
```

---

3. **Flex**: This widget organizes its children along a direction (vertical in this case).
   - `direction: Axis.vertical`: Sets the layout axis.
   - `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center`: Centers the content vertically.

```dart
Flex(
    direction: Axis.vertical,
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: <Widget>[]
)
```

---

4. **Card**: This widget displays a container with a shadow and a default card style.
   - `elevation: 4`: Sets the shadow depth under the card to create a raised effect.
   - `color`: Changes the background color of the card to light blue.

```dart
Card(
    elevation: 4,
    color: Colors.lightBlue[50],
    child: widget
)
```

---

5. **Padding**: Adds internal spacing around the text to improve visual appearance.

```dart
Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 16.0),
    child: widget
)
```

---

6. **Text Widgets**: Each `Text` displays a string with specific styles (color, font size) to customize the display.

```dart
Text(
    'This is a Flex example.',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
)
```

---

**Reflection**: Why might you choose a Stateless over a Stateful widget for certain parts of an app?

%%
A Stateless widget is ideal for UI elements that do not require updates, such as static text or basic styling or layout placement. Stateful widgets are better for components that require interaction or data changes, like user inputs or real-time displays, which need to refresh as the app runs.
%%

---
##### App Lifecycle:

Apps in Flutter have a well-defined lifecycle with init and dispose methods for managing resources and data flow.

---
### Ok, but what is Dart ?

1. Programming **Language**
2. **Open-Source**
3. Made by Google
4. Web and Mobile
5. Made to **replace** JavaScript in browsers
6. **Compiled** language (*JIT* and *AOT*)
7. Easiest to learn

%%
Dart, designed by Google, was introduced as a JavaScript alternative, prioritizing web and mobile applications. Dart’s **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation, which is key to Flutter’s hot reload, allows quick prototyping and debugging during development. The **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** compilation makes it suitable for production by enhancing performance through native machine code compilation. Dart’s simplicity makes it accessible, even for beginners, while offering the robustness needed for complex applications.
%%

#### Brief history, purpose, and why Google created Dart.

- Created in **2011**
- Made by **Google**
- Goal → **Improving** web app's **performance**
- Initially intended to **replace JavaScript** in browsers
- Evolved to a versatile language **for mobile, web, and desktop** apps
- Fast development and performances
- Now upgraded to be **Ideal for Flutter**

%%
Dart was created in 2011 by Google with the goal of improving web app performance. While it was initially intended to replace JavaScript in browsers. However, over time, it becomes a versatile language more suitable for mobile, web, and desktop apps. As it was adopted for Flutter, making it a highly versatile language for both web and mobile development. Dart combines the ease of a scripting language with the performance benefits of a compiled language, making it efficient for developers focused on delivering fast, reliable applications.
%%

---

**Reflection**: Why might Google choose Dart specifically for Flutter, over JavaScript?

%%
Google chose Dart for Flutter due to its flexibility in supporting both AOT and JIT compilation, offering both development efficiency and optimized performance. Dart’s statically typed, compiled nature aligns well with Flutter’s focus on high-performance applications, whereas JavaScript’s interpreted, dynamic typing can introduce runtime inefficiencies.
%%

---
##### Dart Syntax Basics

- **Variables, Constants, and Data Types**: `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`.
- Control flow statements: `if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, and `if-case

%% Dart provides a variety of data types, which allow developers to structure data as needed. `int` and `double` handle numerical data, `String` is for text, and `bool` is for true/false values. Collections such as `List` and `Map` provide structured data storage and are essential for managing data in Dart applications. %%

---
##### Functions and Classes

- **Functions**: Dart functions can have optional parameters and named parameters, which are useful for clarity and flexibility.
- **Classes**: Dart is object-oriented, allowing developers to define classes, constructors, and methods. Objects are instantiated from these classes.

%%
Functions and classes in Dart are foundational elements of the language. Classes help model real-world concepts by encapsulating data and behaviors. Functions allow developers to create reusable code. Dart also supports **optional** and **named parameters**, which simplify function calls and improve readability.
%%

---
#### Dart VS JavaScript

---
##### Compare Dart classes with JavaScript’s class-based syntax.
---
###### JavaScript

```js nums
// Create a new class Person that define what's a person is. 
class Person {
  // Constructor
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  // Method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

// Create a new person instance using the constructor.
const person = new Person('Alice');
// Call the greet function from Person class instance
person.greet();
```

---
###### Dart

```dart nums
// Create a new class Person that define what's a person is.
class Person {
  // Parameters
  String name;
  
  // Constructor
  Person(this.name);
  
  // Method
  void greet() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name.');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create a new person instance using the constructor.
  const person = Person('Alice');
  // Call the greet function from Person class instance
  person.greet();
}
```

---
##### Show differences in syntax, performance, and usage

- **Syntax**: Dart is a statically typed language with explicit types, while JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- **Performance**: Dart's AOT compilation allows better performance for production, whereas JavaScript is typically interpreted.
- **Usage**: Dart is ideal for mobile and web applications via Flutter, while JavaScript remains the dominant language for general web development.

%%
Dart uses **static typing**, meaning data types are defined explicitly, while JavaScript’s **dynamic typing** determines types during runtime. Dart is optimized for performance through AOT compilation, while JavaScript, being an interpreted language, often requires runtime optimization techniques. These distinctions make Dart more suited for apps that need high performance, while JavaScript’s flexibility suits general web development.
%%

---

**Reflection**: Compare Dart's syntax with JavaScript. How does static typing in Dart differ from JavaScript’s dynamic typing?

%%
Dart's **static typing** means types are defined at compile-time, allowing the compiler to check for type errors before the code runs. This can reduce runtime errors and improve performance, as the compiler has a clear expectation of the type of data each variable should hold. In contrast, JavaScript’s **dynamic typing** allows variables to hold any type of data at runtime, which offers more flexibility but can lead to unexpected type-related errors during execution. Static typing in Dart, therefore, provides stronger guarantees around data handling, which is especially useful for complex applications where consistency and reliability are crucial.
