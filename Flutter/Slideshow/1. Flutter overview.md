### What is Flutter ?

1. A **framework**
2. **Open-Source**
3. Made by **Google**
4. Allow **native** applications for multiple platforms 
5. Single code-base
6. Same appearance and behavior
7. Made for designer
8. Built in Dart

%%
Flutter is an open-source framework developed by Google, which enables the creation of native applications for multiple platforms from a single code base, and can provide applications with identical appearance and behavior, regardless of device or operating system. With Flutter, developers can create apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, as well as web applications, all using the Dart programming language.

#### The framework

Overview of the framework, Single codebase advantage, and multi-platform support.

%% 
Flutter is a comprehensive UI toolkit from Google designed for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It emphasizes high-performance apps with a **single codebase** that look and feel the same across different platforms. %%

---
#### Advantages and limitations of Flutter

---
##### Advantages

- Single codebase for multiple platforms saves development time and effort.
- High-performance rendering with Flutter’s own graphics engine (Skia).
- Hot reload speeds up development by instantly showing changes.
- Strong open-source community and support from Google.

---
##### Limitations

- Larger app size compared to natively built apps.
- Limited access to some platform-specific features.
- Less mature support for web and desktop compared to mobile.

---
#### Key Flutter concepts (Widgets, Hot Reload, Dart)

- **Widgets**: The core building blocks of Flutter apps. Everything in Flutter is a widget (e.g., text, buttons, layouts).
- **Hot Reload**: Enables developers to see changes instantly in the app without restarting it, which speeds up development.
- **Dart**: The language used to write Flutter apps, designed for building fast apps with a clean, modern syntax.

---
##### More and more widgets

- **Stateless Widgets**: 
	- Immutable: Once created, their state never changes
	- Used for simple interface elements that do not require updating

- **Stateful Widgets**: 
	- Mutable state: They can be dynamically updated
	- Used for complex interactions and animations

%%
In Flutter, the user interface is built from visual components called *widgets*. A widget is the basic element of any Flutter application, representing visual elements such as buttons, text, images or even layouts. In fact, everything in Flutter is a widget, and together they define the shape and behavior of your application.
%%

###### Example: A Flutter Widget

Here's an example of a simple *Stateless Widget* that displays a card containing the message `Hello, Flutter with Card!`, followed by stylized text `This is a Flex example.`

```dart nums
class CardExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Flex(
      direction: Axis.vertical,
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Card(
          elevation: 4,
          color: Colors.lightBlue[50],
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter with Card!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blueAccent),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 16.0),
          child: Text(
            'This is a Flex example.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

---

1. **CardExample**: This is a *StatelessWidget* that uses `Flex` to align widgets vertically.

```dart
class CardExample extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
}
```

---

3. **Flex**: This widget organizes its children along a direction (vertical in this case).
   - `direction: Axis.vertical`: Sets the layout axis.
   - `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center`: Centers the content vertically.

```dart
Flex(
    direction: Axis.vertical,
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: <Widget>[]
)
```

---

4. **Card**: This widget displays a container with a shadow and a default card style.
   - `elevation: 4`: Sets the shadow depth under the card to create a raised effect.
   - `color`: Changes the background color of the card to light blue.

```dart
Card(
    elevation: 4,
    color: Colors.lightBlue[50],
    child: widget
)
```

---

5. **Padding**: Adds internal spacing around the text to improve visual appearance.

```dart
Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 16.0),
    child: widget
)
```

---

6. **Text Widgets**: Each `Text` displays a string with specific styles (color, font size) to customize the display.

```dart
Text(
    'This is a Flex example.',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
)
```

---
### Why Choose Flutter?

---
#### Flutter’s open-source ecosystem and contributions from Google

- **Open-Source Ecosystem**: Flutter is open source, meaning it is free to use and has a strong developer community constantly contributing to improvements.
- **Google’s Support**: Created and maintained by Google, Flutter has a strong foundation and benefits from continuous enhancements and reliable support.

---
#### Comparison with other cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Xamarin, etc.)

- **React Native**: Uses JavaScript, allows access to native components, but requires bridging code for more advanced features.
- **Xamarin**: Uses C#, provides access to native APIs but can have larger build sizes and a slower build process compared to Flutter.

---
### Exploring Flutter’s Components

---
#### Structure of a Flutter app, importance of widgets, and the app lifecycle

---
##### App Structure:
A typical Flutter app contains a `main.dart` file as the entry point. Apps are structured around widgets.

---
##### Widgets: 

Everything in Flutter is a widget, and they are categorized as Stateless (immutable) or Stateful (dynamic).

---
##### App Lifecycle:

Apps in Flutter have a well-defined lifecycle with init and dispose methods for managing resources and data flow.

---
### Ok, but what is Dart ?

1. Programming **Language**
2. **Open-Source**
3. Made by Google
4. Web and Mobile
5. Made to **replace** JavaScript in browsers
6. **Compiled** language (*JIT* and *AOT*)
7. Easiest to learn

%%
Dart, the programming language behind the Flutter Framework, is also a Google Open-Source project designed for web and mobile application development.  
Its aim was to replace JavaScript in web browsers with a more modern compiled **Just-In-Time (JIT)** and **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** language centered around Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), while remaining easy to learn for all types of profiles.
%%

---

> [!info] 
> - **Just-In-Time** compilation *(Used during development with Flutter)* enables hot reloading, quick code update to view changes in real time.
> - **Ahead-Of-Time** compilation *(Used for the final version of the application)* enabling it to be compiled directly into native machine code for better performance.

##### Dart Syntax Basics

- **Variables, Constants, and Data Types**: `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`.
- Control flow statements: `if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, and `if-case

---

> [!NOTE]
> - [Numbers](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#numbers) (`int`, `double`)
> - [Strings](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#strings) (`String`)
> - [Booleans](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#booleans) (`bool`)
> - The value `null` (`Null`)

---

> [!NOTE]

> - [Symbols](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#symbols) (`Symbol`)

---
##### Functions and Classes

- **Functions**: Dart functions can have optional parameters and named parameters, which are useful for clarity and flexibility.
- **Classes**: Dart is object-oriented, allowing developers to define classes, constructors, and methods. Objects are instantiated from these classes.

---
#### Dart VS JavaScript

---
##### Compare Dart classes with JavaScript’s class-based syntax.
---
###### JavaScript

```js nums
// Create a new class Person that define what's a person is. 
class Person {
  // Constructor
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  // Method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

// Create a new person instance using the constructor.
const person = new Person('Alice');
// Call the greet function from Person class instance
person.greet();
```

---
###### Dart

```dart nums
// Create a new class Person that define what's a person is.
class Person {
  // Parameters
  String name;
  
  // Constructor
  Person(this.name);
  
  // Method
  void greet() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name.');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create a new person instance using the constructor.
  const person = Person('Alice');
  // Call the greet function from Person class instance
  person.greet();
}
```

---
##### Show differences in syntax, performance, and usage

- **Syntax**: Dart is a statically typed language with explicit types, while JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- **Performance**: Dart's AOT compilation allows better performance for production, whereas JavaScript is typically interpreted.
- **Usage**: Dart is ideal for mobile and web applications via Flutter, while JavaScript remains the dominant language for general web development.

---
#### Hands-on Dart Exercises

- **Install Flutter SDK** and set up the development environment.
- **Write Dart functions** to perform simple tasks (like calculating sums, displaying text).
- **Practice control flow** and **data structures** by creating small programs.
